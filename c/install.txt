-----------
Assuming you are using the terminal, follow these steps to compile and run your program:

1. **Open Terminal:**
   - Open a terminal window on your computer.

2. **Navigate to the Build Directory:**
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where your `CMakeLists.txt` file is and where the `build` directory is located. For example:
     ```bash
     cd /path/to/your/project/build
     ```

3. **Run CMake:**
   - Run CMake to generate the build files:
     ```bash
     cmake ..
     ```

4. **Compile the Program:**
   - Compile the program using the generated build files:
     ```bash
     cmake --build .
     ```

5. **Run the Executable:**
   - Run the executable that was generated in the `build` directory:
     ```bash
     ./MySDLApp
     ```

   - If you encounter any issues, check the terminal output for error messages.

Please try running the program with the modified `main.c` and let me know if you observe any error messages or if the window remains empty.
