In this case, you just need to update your CMake command to reflect the new structure:

1. **Clean the Build Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/jmlz_rp/Documents/AZEN/C-app/c
   rm -rf build
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

   This will remove the existing build directory and create a new one.

2. **Run CMake Again:**
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```

   Make sure you are inside the newly created `build` directory when running this command.

3. **Build Your Project:**
   ```bash
   cmake --build .
   ```

Now, you should be able to run your application using `./MySDLApp` inside the `build` directory. This approach keeps the build directory separate from the source directory, preventing conflicts. If you face any issues or have further questions, feel free to ask.
